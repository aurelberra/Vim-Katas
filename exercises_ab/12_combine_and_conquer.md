Use this text for practicing:

```text
This test text, I like it.
one MORE
And more
```

Do the following exercises on it:

`2cw` - change 2 words <!-- HACK: -->
`2dw` - delete 2 words
`2yw` - yank 2 words into register
`g~`  - swap case
`gu`  - make selection all lower case
`gU`  - make selection all UPPER case
`>`   - shift right
`<`   - shift left
`=`   - auto indent <!-- HACK: -->
